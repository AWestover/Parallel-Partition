%% Practical work on parallel partition. Does not concern itself with having low-span algorithms. More focused on optimizing practical algorithms for number of comparisons, or something like that.

%% A Linear-span algorithm with a good engineering constant and that behaves well on random inputs; Even then I think it will have span at least sqrt(n).
