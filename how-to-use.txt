To reproduce the experiments in writeup.pdf:
(1) Modify params.h so that exactly one of USE_CILK or RUN_SERIAL are defined; this determines which experiment you are running.
(2) Run make to compile the code. (I used GCC 7.3.0; note that CILK is not included in some later versions)
(3) To run the code on 18 cores, we run
    numactl --interleave=all taskset -c 0-17 ./main
    where the "numactl --interleave=all" is in order to use a
    muma-friendly memory-allocation policy and the "taskset -c 0-17"
    isto assign threads to distinct cores (in order to disable
    hyperthreading).
(4) Place the output in serialtable.tex or paralleltable.tex
(depending on whether you ran a serial or parallel experiment), and
run the command "pdflatex writeup" to recompile the paper. The new
graphs should appear in writeup.pdf.
