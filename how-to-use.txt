To reproduce the experiments in writeup.pdf:
(1) Modify params.h so that exactly one of USE_CILK or RUN_SERIAL are defined; this determines which experiment you are running.
(2) Run make to compile the code. (I used GCC 7.3.1)
(3) If executing the serial experiment, run:   ./main > serialtable.tex
    If executing the parallel experiment, run: ./main > cilktable.tex
(4) Recompile the writeup document by running: pdflatex writeup
The table in writeup.pdf should now reflect the experiment you ran.
