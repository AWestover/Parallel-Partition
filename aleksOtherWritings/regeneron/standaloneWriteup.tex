\maketitle
\begin{abstract} The parallel-partition problem, which is essential to Parallel
	Quicksort and appears in many other algorithms, is given an array $A$ of
	length $n$, and must partition the array based on some pivot property. The
	standard solution to the parallel-partition problem is out-of-place. Having
	an in-place algorithm is desirable because it makes the algorithm faster in
	practice and because sorting problems are often memory intensive so extra
	space may be undesirable or high cost. Kuszmaul developed an in-place
	algorithm for the parallel-partition problem, but the algorithm performs
	multiple passes over the array and thus its performance is bottlenecked by
	memory-bandwidth. The Blocked Strided Algorithm of Francis, Pannan, Frias, and
	Petit is in-place and under certain conditions performs little more than a
	single pass over the array. Because of this, for certain inputs the Blocked
	Strided Algorithm incurs very few cache misses and thus performs well.
	However in general this algorithm has no theoretical guarantees on span and
	cache-behavior.

	We present an in-place EREW algorithm with polylogarithmic span and provably
	optimal cache behavior, up to small-order factors.  The resulting algorithm
	achieves near-ideal scaling in practice by avoiding the memory-bandwidth
	bottleneck. The algorithm's performance is comparable to that of the Blocked
	Strided Algorithm, the previous state-of-the art for parallel EREW sorting
	algorithms.

% This means that they can be implemented using only parallel for loops, and do
	% not require the use of any concurrency mechanisms such as locks or atomic
	% variables. Despite the parallel-partition problem being heavily studied, no
	% algorithms have achieved these theoretical guarantees before.

\section{Introduction}

A \defn{parallel partition} operation rearranges the elements in an
array so that the elements satisfying a particular \defn{pivot
  property} appear first. In addition to playing a central role in
parallel quicksort, the parallel partition operation is used as a
primitive throughout parallel algorithms.\footnote{In several
  well-known textbooks and surveys on parallel algorithms
  \cite{AcarBl16,Blelloch96}, for example, parallel partitions are
  implicitly used extensively to perform what are referred to as
  \emph{filter} operations.}

A parallel algorithm can be measured by its \defn{work}, the time
needed to execute in serial, and its \defn{span}, the time to execute
on infinitely many processors. There is a well-known algorithm for
parallel partition on arrays of size $n$ with work $O(n)$ and span
$O(\log n)$ \cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16}. Moreover, the algorithm uses
only exclusive read/write shared memory variables (i.e., it is an
\defn{EREW} algorithm). This eliminates the need for concurrency
mechanisms such as locks and atomic variables, and ensures good
behavior even if the time to access a location is a function of the
number of threads trying to access it (or its cache line)
concurrently. EREW algorithms also have the advantage that their
behavior is internally deterministic, meaning that
the behavior of the algorithm will not differ from run to run, which
makes test coverage, debugging, and reasoning about performance
substantially easier \cite{BlellochFi12}.

This parallel-partition algorithm suffers from using a large amount of
auxiliary memory, however. Whereas the serial algorithm is typically
implemented in place, the parallel algorithm relies on the use of two
auxiliary arrays of size $n$. To the best of our knowledge, the only
known linear-work and $\operatorname{polylog}(n)$-span algorithms for
parallel partition that are in-place require the use of atomic
operations (e.g, fetch-and-add)
\cite{HeidelbergerNo90,AxtmannWi17,TsigasZh03}.

An algorithm's memory efficiency can be critical on large inputs. The
memory consumption of an algorithm determines the largest problem size
that can be executed in memory. Many external memory algorithms (i.e.,
algorithms for problems too large to fit in memory) perform large
subproblems in memory; the size of these subproblems is again
bottlenecked by the algorithm's memory-overhead \cite{Vitter08}. In
multi-user systems, processes with larger memory-footprints can hog
the cache and the memory bandwidth, slowing down other processes.

For sorting algorithms, in particular, special attention to memory
efficiency is often given. This is because (a) a user calling the sort
function may already be using almost all of the memory in the system;
and (b) sorting algorithms, and especially parallel sorting
algorithms, are often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. The latter
property, in particular, means that any parallel sorting algorithm
that wishes to achieve state-of-the art performance on a large
multi-processor machine must be (at least close to) in place.

Currently the only practical in-place parallel sorting algorithms
either rely heavily on atomic operations or other concurrency
mechanisms \cite{HeidelbergerNo90, AxtmannWi17, TsigasZh03}, or eschew
theoretical guarantees \cite{FrancisPa92}. Parallel merge sort
\cite{Hagerup89} was made in-place by Katajainen \cite{Katajainen93},
but has proven too sophisticated for practical applications. Bitonic
sort \cite{BlellochLe98} is naturally in-place, and can be practical
in certain applications on super computers, but suffers in general
from requiring work $\Theta(n \log^2 n)$ rather than $O(n \log
n)$. Parallel quicksort, on the other hand, despite the many efforts
to optimize it \cite{HeidelbergerNo90, AxtmannWi17, TsigasZh03,
  FrancisPa92, Frias08}, has eluded any in-place EREW (or CREW)
algorithms due to its reliance on parallel partition.\footnote{In a \defn{CREW}
algorithm, reads may be concurrent, but writes may not. CREW stands for
\emph{concurrent-read exclusive-write}.}

\paragraph{Results}
We will highlight past work demonstrating that parallel partition can be
implemented in place. However, this in-place implementation remains
bottlenecked by memory bandwidth, due to the fact that multiple passes over the
input array are required. 

The memory-bandwidth bottleneck has led past researchers \cite{FrancisPa92,
Frias08} to introduce the so-called \defn{Strided Algorithm}, which has near
optimal cache behavior in practice, but which exhibits theoretical guarantees
only on certain inputs such as random input arrays.

Our main result is an algorithm that we call the \defn{Smoothed Striding
Algorithm}. By randomly perturbing the internal structure of the Strided
Algorithm, and adding a recursion step that was previously not possible, we
arrive at a new algorithm with provably good span and cache behavior. The
Smoothed Striding Algorithm is in-place, has polylogarithmic span, and exhibits
provably optimal cache behavior up to small-order factors. In practice, the
Smoothed Striding Algorithm performs within 15\% of the Strided Algorithm on a
large number of threads.



\section{Preliminaries}\label{secprelim}

We begin by describing the the parallelism and memory model used in the paper,
and by presenting background on parallel partition.

\paragraph{Workflow Model} We consider a simple language-based model of
parallelism in which algorithms achieve parallelism through the use of
\defn{parallel-for-loops} (see, e.g., \cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16,CLRS});
function calls within the inner loop then allow for more complicated parallel
structures (e.g., recursion). Our algorithms can also be implemented in the
less restrictive PRAM model \cite{Blelloch96, AcarBl16}.

Formally, a parallel-for-loop is given a range $R \in \mathbb{N}$, a constant
number of arguments $\arg_1, \arg_2, \ldots, \arg_c$, and a body of code. For
each $i \in \{1, \ldots, R\}$, the loop launches a thread that is given
loop-counter $i$ and local copies of the arguments $\arg_1, \arg_2, \ldots,
\arg_c$. The threads are then taken up by processors and the iterations of the
loop are performed in parallel. Only after every iteration of the loop is
complete can control flow continue past the loop.

A parallel algorithm may be run on an arbitrary number $p$ of
processors. The algorithm itself is oblivious to $p$, however, leaving
the assignment of threads to processors up to a scheduler.

The \defn{work} $T_1$ of an algorithm is the time that the algorithm
would require to execute on a single processor. The \defn{span}
$T_\infty$ of an algorithm is the time to execute on infinitely many
processors. The scheduler is assumed to contribute no overhead to the
span. In particular, if each iteration of a
parallel-for-loop has span $s$, then the full parallel loop has span
$s + O(1)$ \cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16}.

The work $T_1$ and span $T_\infty$ can be used to quantify the time $T_p$
that an algorithm requires to execute on $p$ processors using a greedy
online scheduler. If the scheduler is assumed to contribute no
overhead, then Brent's Theorem \cite{Brent74} states that for any
$p$,
$$T_1 / p \le T_p \le T_1 / p + T_\infty.$$

The work-stealing algorithms used in the Cilk extension of C/C++ realize
the guarantee offered by Brent's Theorem within a constant factor
\cite{BlumofeJo96,BlumofeLe99}, with the added caveat that parallel-for-loops
typically induce an additional additive overhead of $O(\log R)$. 

\paragraph{Memory Model} Memory is \defn{exclusive-read} and \defn{exclusive-write}. That is, no two threads are ever permitted to attempt to read or write to the same variable concurrently. 
The exclusive-read exclusive-write memory model is sometime referred
to as the \defn{EREW model} (see, e.g., \cite{Hagerup89}).

Note that threads are not in lockstep (i.e., they may progress at arbitrary different speeds), and thus the EREW model requires algorithms to be data-race free in order to avoid the possibility of non-exclusive data accesses.

In an \defn{in-place} algorithm, each thread is given $O(\polylog n)$
memory upon creation that is deallocated when the thread dies. This
memory can be shared with the thread's children. However, the depth of
the parent-child tree is not permitted to exceed $O(\polylog n)$.

Whereas the EREW memory model prohibits concurrent accesses to memory, on the
other side of the spectrum are CRCW (concurrent-read-concurrent-write) models,
which allow for both reads and writes to be performed concurrently (and in some
variants even allow for atomic operations)
\cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16,MatiasVi95}. One approach to designing efficient EREW
algorithms is to simulate efficient CRCW algorithms in the EREW model
\cite{MatiasVi95}. The known simulation techniques require substantial space
overhead, however, preventing the design of in-place algorithms
\cite{MatiasVi95}.\footnote{The known simulation techniques also increase the
total work in the original algorithm, although this can be acceptable if only a
small number of atomic operations need to be simulated.}

%% HERE: Is where we can talk about the more powerful alternative to EREW, and there relationship, and why we can't just simulate CRCW (or, more importantly, ERCW). Make it clear that the Exclusive Read part is not actually very important -- it's the exclusive write part that's hard.

%% \footnote{The
  %% algorithm in this paper satisfies a slightly stronger property that
  %% the total memory being used is never more than $O(\log n) \cdot p$,
  %% where $p$ is an upper-bound on the number of worker threads.}

\paragraph{Modeling Cache Misses}
We treat memory as consisting of fixed-size cache lines of some
size $b$. Each processor is assumed to have a small cache of
$\operatorname{polylog}{n}$ cache lines.  A cache miss occurs on a
processor when the line being accessed is not currently in cache, in
which case some other line is evicted from cache to make room for the
new entry.  Each cache is managed with a LRU (Least Recently Used)
eviction policy; when child threads are created, they inherit their
cache contents from their parent.

We will also assume that the algorithm can choose for certain small
arrays to be pinned in cache (i.e. their entries are never evicted
from cache).  This assumption is without loss of generality in the
sense that LRU eviction is competitive (up to resource augmentation)
with the optimal off-line eviction strategy OPT (i.e. Furthest in the
Future). Formally this is due to the following theorem by Sleator and
Tarjan:
\begin{theorem}[Resource Augmentation Theorem \cite{SleatorTa85}]
  LRU operating on a cache of size $K\cdot M$ for some $K>1$ will incur at most $1+\frac{1}{K-1}$ times the number of times cache misses of OPT operating on a cache of size $M$, for the same series of memory accesses.
  \label{thm:augmentation}
\end{theorem}

Recall that each processor has a cache of size $\log^c n$ for $c$ a
constant of our choice.  Up to changes in $c$ LRU incurs no more than
a $1+\frac{1}{\operatorname{polylog}{n}}$ factor more cache misses
than OPT incurs. Thus, up to a $1 + \frac{1}{\polylog(n)}$
multiplicative change in cache misses, and a $\polylog(n)$ change in
cache size, we may assume without loss of generality that cache
eviction is performed by OPT. Such an assumption will not be necessary
for our algorithm analyses, however; instead it will suffice to assume
that certain small arrays are pinned in cache and that other evictions
are performed via LRU.

\paragraph{The Partition Problem}
The partition problem takes an input array $A$ of size $n$,
and a \defn{decider function} $\dec$ that determines for each element
$A[i] \in A$ whether or not $A[i]$ is a \defn{predecessor} or a
\defn{successor}. That is, $\dec(A[i]) = 1$ if $A[i]$ is a
predecessor, and $\dec(A[i]) = 0$ if $A[i]$ is a successor. The
behavior of the partition algorithm is to reorder the elements in the
array $A$ so that the predecessors appear before the successors.


\paragraph{The Serial Partition Algorithm}
In our parallel algorithms for the partition problem we perform serial partitions on disjoint subarrays of the array.
The serial partition algorithm runs fully in-place and incurs work  linear in the input size i.e. $O(N)$. 
Also, crucially, the serial partition algorithm makes a single pass over the array, so it incurs only $n/b$ cache misses where $b$ is the size of a cache line.
See Algorithm \ref{alg:serialPartition} for a pseudocode implementation of this algorithm.

\paragraph{The (Standard) Linear-Space Parallel Partition} The linear-space implementation of parallel partition consists of two phases \cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16}:

\noindent\emph{The Parallel-Prefix Phase: }In this phase, the algorithm
constructs an array $B$ whose $i$-th element $B[i] = \sum_{j = 1}^i
\dec(A[i])$ is the number of predecessors in the first $i$ elements of
$A$. The transformation from $A$ to $B$ is called a \defn{parallel
  prefix sum} and can be performed with $O(n)$ work and $O(\log n)$
span using a simple recursive algorithm: (1) First construct an array
$A'$ of size $n / 2$ with $A'[i] = A[2i - 1] + A[2i]$; (2)
Recursively construct a parallel prefix sum $B'$ of $A'$; (3) Build
$B$ by setting each $B[i] = B'[\lfloor i / 2 \rfloor] + A[i]$ for odd
$i$ and $B[i] = A'[i / 2]$ for even $i$. 

\noindent\emph{The Reordering Phase: }In this phase, the algorithm
constructs an output-array $C$ by placing each predecessor $A[i] \in A$
in position $B[i]$ of $C$. If there are $t$ predecessors in $A$, then
the first $t$ elements of $C$ will now contain those $t$ predecessors
in the same order that they appear in $A$. The algorithm then places
each successor $A[i] \in A$ in position $t + i - B[i]$. Since $i - B[i]$
is the number of successors in the first $i$ elements of $A$, this
places the successors in $C$ in the same order that they appear in
$A$. Finally, the algorithm copies $C$ into $A$, completing the
parallel partition.

Both phases can be implemented with $O(n)$ work and $O(\log n)$
span. Like its serial out-of-place counterpart, the algorithm is
stable but not in place. The algorithm uses two auxiliary arrays of
size $n$. Kiu, Knowles, and Davis \cite{LiuKn05} were able to reduce
the extra space consumption to $n + p$ under the assumption that the
number of processors $p$ is hard-coded; their algorithm breaks the
array $A$ into $p$ parts and assigns one part to each thread. 

\paragraph{An In-Place Parallel Partition}
Kuszmaul\cite{KuszmaulWe19} created an in-place parallel-prefix-sum based
algorithm for parallel partition.  Kuszmaul's algorithm has span $O(\log n \log
\log n)$ which is comparable to the $O(\log n)$ span of the standard algorithm.
Because Kuszmaul's algorithm is in-place it has better cache-behavior,
specifically better spatial locality.  Because of the improved cache behavior
Kuszmaul's in-place algorithm outperforms the standard linear-space parallel
partition algorithm in practice.  However, experiments also reveal that
Kuszmaul's in-place algorithm is still bottlenecked by cache misses. Kuszmaul's
algorithm is does not have optimal temporal locality. Because the algorithm
performs multiple passes over the array it incurs more cache misses than is
optimal.  Because of the suboptimal cache-behavior, the memory bandwidth bound
bottlenecks the algorithm which prevents optimal scaling.


\section{Cache-Efficient Parallel Partition for \emph{Random} Input Arrays}\label{sec:strided}

In this Section we present and analyze the Strided Algorithm \cite{FrancisPa92}.
The Strided Algorithm lacks theoretical guarantees in general, but we prove
that for random inputs it has desirable cache behavior.

\paragraph{The Strided Algorithm Description \cite{FrancisPa92}}
The Strided Algorithm is designed to behave well on random
arrays $A$, achieving span $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ and exhibiting only $n/b +
\tilde{O}(n^{2/3} / b)$  cache misses on such inputs. On worst-case inputs,
however, the Strided Algorithm has span $\Omega(n)$ and incurs $n/b +
\Omega(n/b)$ cache misses. 
% Our algorithm, the Smoothed Striding Algorithm, will build on the Strided Algorithm by randomly perturbing the internal structure of the original algorithm; in doing so, we are able to provide provable guarantees on arbitrary inputs, and to add a recursion step that was previously impossible.

The original \defn{Strided Algorithm} consists of two steps: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Partial Partition Step.} Let $g \in \mathbb{N}$ be a
  parameter, and assume for simplicity that $gb \mid n$. Partition the
  array $A$ into $\frac{n}{gb}$ chunks $C_1, \ldots, C_{n / gb}$,
  each consisting of $g$ cache lines of size $b$.
  %% \footnote{In this
  %%   gection we zero-index arrays in order to enable modular arithmetic
  %%   on array indices.}
	For $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, g\}$, define 
  $P_i$ to consist of the $i$-th cache line from each of the
  chunks $C_1, \ldots, C_{n / gb}$. One can think of the $P_i$'s
	as forming a strided partition of array $A$, since
  consecutive cache lines in $P_i$ are always separated by a fixed
  stride of $g - 1$ other cache lines.

  The first step of the algorithm is to perform an in-place serial
  partition on each of the $P_i$s, rearranging the elements within the
  $P_i$ so that the predecessors come first. This step requires work
  $\Theta(n)$ and span $\Theta(n/g)$.
\item \textbf{The Serial Cleanup Step. }For each $P_i$, define the \defn{splitting position} $v_i$ to be
  the position in $A$ of the final predecessor in (the already
  partitioned) $P_i$. Define $v_{\text{min}} = \min\{v_1, \ldots,
  v_{g}\}$ and define $v_{\text{max}} = \max\{v_1, \ldots, v_{g}\}$. Then the
  second step of the algorithm is to perform a serial partition on the
	sub-array \\$A[v_{\text{min}}],\ldots, A[v_{\text{max}}-1]$. This completes the   
    full partition.
\end{itemize}

Note that the Cleanup Step of the Strided Algorithm has no
parallelism, and thus has span $\Theta(v_{\text{max}} -
v_{\text{min}})$.  In general, this results in an algorithm with
linear-span (i.e., no parallelism guarantee).  When the number of
predecessors in each of the $P_i$'s is close to equal, however, the
quantity $v_{\text{max}} - v_{\text{min}}$ can be much smaller than
$O(n)$.  For example, if $b = 1$, and if each element of $A$ is
selected independently from some distribution, then one can use
Chernoff bounds to prove that with high probability in $n$,
$v_{\text{max}} - v_{\text{min}} \le O(\sqrt{n \cdot g \cdot \log
  n})$.  The full span of the algorithm is then $\tilde{O}(n/g +
\sqrt{n \cdot g})$, which optimizes at $g = n^{1/3}$ to
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$. Since the Partial Partition Step incurs only $n
/ b$ cache misses, the full algorithm incurs $n + \tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ cache
misses on a random array $A$.


Using Hoeffding's Inequality in place of Chernoff bounds, one can
obtain analogous bounds for larger values of $b$; in particular for $b
\in \operatorname{polylog}(n)$, the optimal span remains
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ and the number of cache misses becomes $n / b +
\tilde{O}(n^{2/3} / b)$ on an array $A$ consisting of randomly sampled
elements.\footnote{The original algorithm of Francis and Pannan
  \cite{FrancisPa92} does not consider the cache-line size $b$. Frias
  and Petit later introduced the parameter $b$ \cite{Frias08}, and
  showed that by setting $b$ appropriately, one obtains an algorithm
  whose empirical performance is close to the state-of-the-art.}

\paragraph{Strided Algorithm Analysis}
We now prove the following theorem about the Strided Algorithm's performance:
\begin{theorem}
Given an array $A[0], A[1], \ldots, A[n-1]$ where each $A[i]$ is chosen randomly independently to be either $0$ or $1$, and a decider function that labels each element with value $0$ a predecessor, and each element with the value $1$ a successor, the Strided Algorithm partitions the array in span that is, with high probability in n, $O(\frac{n}{t}+\sqrt{n\cdot t\cdot\log n})$ where $t$ is a parameter of our choice indicating the number of parts that we break $A$ into, incurring $n\cdot(1+o(1))$ cache misses.
\label{thm:stridedAlg}
\end{theorem}

To do this, we first prove the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
With high probability in $n$, the size of the recursive subproblem, $v_{max} - v_{min}$, is $O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}).$
\label{lem:epsSmallFP}
\end{lemma}

To prove this, we use Chernoff Bounds, which give bounds on the probability of a deviation of a random variable from its mean (expected value) $\mu$ by more than a certain amount.
We first bound the number of predecessors $x_i$ in each part $P_i$, which allows us to bound $v_i$, the index in the array $A$ of the first successor in $P_i$ after $P_i$ has been partitioned.

The Multiplicative Chernoff bound bounds the probability of a random variable such as $x_i$ deviating by more than $\delta \cdot \mu$ from its mean.
Specifically it says,
$$P(x_i>\mu(1+\delta)) = O(e^{-\mu \cdot \delta^2/3}).$$
We want to know what value of $\delta$ makes $x_i\leq\mu(1+\delta)$ with high probability.
To find the smallest $\delta$ satisfying this, we must solve 
$$O(e^{-\mu \cdot \delta^2/3}) = n^{-c},$$
where the right hand side comes from the definition of an event being false with high probability, and the left hand side comes from the probability guaranteed by the Chernoff bound.
Solving, we obtain 
$$\log e^{-\mu \cdot \delta^2/3} = \log n^{-c},$$
which upon isolating $\delta$ yields,
$$\delta = O\paren*{\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\mu}}}.$$
Because $x_i$ is the number of predecessors in $P_i$, and $|P_i| \approx \frac{n}{t}$, the expectation of $x_i$ is $\mu = \frac{n}{2t}$ because the values in A were generated independently at random, with $\frac{1}{2}$ probability of being predecessors.
Thus we can assert that 
$$\delta = O\paren*{\sqrt{\frac{t\log n}{n}}}.$$
By a nearly identical argument with the Chernoff bound for the probability of $x_i$ deviating below the mean $\mu$ by more than $\mu \cdot \delta$ we get the same result: that deviation by more than $\mu \cdot \delta$ does not happen with high probability.

Thus we have that with high probability
$$|x_i - \mu| = O\paren*{\sqrt{\frac{t\log n}{n}}} \cdot \mu.$$
Once again we can substitute in $\mu=\frac{n}{2t}$ to get,
$$|x_i - \mu| = O\paren*{\sqrt{\frac{t\log n}{n}}} \cdot \frac{n}{2t}.$$
This simplifies to,
$$\Big|x_i - \frac{n}{2t}\Big| = O\paren*{\sqrt{\frac{n\log n}{t}}}.$$
To convert this index to an index into the array A rather than an index in $P_i$, we multiply by $t$ (the gap between the indices into the array A of elements in $P_i$) obtaining,
$$\Big|t\cdot x_i - \frac{n}{2}\Big| = O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}).$$
Equivalently, we can use our name $v_i$ for the index into the array $A$ to write this as
$$\Big|v_i - \frac{n}{2}\Big| = O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}).$$
We now need to move the discussion from just looking at $P_i$ to looking at all $P_i$s.

\paragraph{Union Bound over all $P_i$}
Now, we apply the union bound for with high probability events.
It states that the union of a set of events that are false with high probability is still false with high probability.
Using the union bound allows us to go from saying 
\begin{multline*}
\text{for all $i$, with high probability} \\ 
	|v_i - \frac{n}{2}| = O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}),
\end{multline*}
to saying 
\begin{multline*}
	\text{with high probability, for all $i$} \\ 
	|v_i - \frac{n}{2}| = O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}).
\end{multline*}
This establishes that, with high probability, 
$$v_{max}-v_{min} = O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}).$$
\end{proof}
Using this lemma we can now prove Theorem \ref{thm:stridedAlg}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:stridedAlg}] $ $\\ \paragraph{Span}
	There are 2 contributions to the span of our algorithm.  First, there is a
	contribution of $\frac{n}{t}$ for performing serial partitions on each $P_i$
	in parallel because serial partition has a running time that is on the order
	of the input array, and $|P_i| = \frac{n}{t}$.  Second, there is a
	contribution from performing a serial partition on the subarray of size
	$v_{min} - v_{max}$ which is $O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n})$ by Lemma
	\ref{lem:epsSmallFP}.  Thus the total span is $$T_\infty = O(n/t+\sqrt{t\cdot
	n \log n}).$$ \\ We can choose $t$ in order to minimize span.  To minimize
	span, ignore the log factor and set $$n/t = \sqrt{t\cdot n} \implies
	t=n^{1/3}.$$ This yields the minimum span, because if either term could be
	decreased, then the function would not be at a minimum, so the terms must be
	equal.  This yields a span of $O(n^{2/3}).$

\paragraph{Cache Misses} The number of cache misses in a serial partition is
the input size, so the total number of cache misses in this program is $t \cdot
\frac{n}{t}$ from the serial partitioning of the $P_i$s in parallel, plus
$O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n})$ for when the algorithm performs a serial partition
on the subarray. So the total number of cache misses is $$n + O(\sqrt{t\cdot
n\log n}).$$ To show that the second term in this sum becomes insignificant
compared to $n$ as $n$ grows, we take $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sqrt{t\cdot n
\log n}}{n} = \sqrt{\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{t\cdot \log n}{n}}.$$ We can't
choose $t>n$, and making $t = o(\frac{n}{\log n})$ is a reasonable constraint
which guarantees that, $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{t}{\paren*{\frac{n}{\log n}}} =
0.$$ Thus, the algorithm only incurs $n+o(n) = n(1+o(1))$ cache misses.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Spatial locality}
The Strided Algorithm as described above is good because of the low number of
cache misses, but it is not good in that there is no spatial locality in
referencing elements of each $P_i$.  A way to increase spatial cache
friendliness of the algorithm is to redefine the parts $P_i$s using blocks of
adjacent elements instead of individual elements each separated by $t$ indices
for each $P_i$.  Let $b$ be the \defn{block size}. \\ To compute $v_i$, the
index into $A$ of the first successor in the partitioned $P_i$, we must now
compute which block the index $x_i$ into $P_i$ falls in, denoted by $w_i$ and
where within the block $x_i$ falls, denoted $m_i$ as follows: $$w_i =
\Big\lfloor \frac{x_i}{b} \Big\rfloor,\,\, m_i=x_i \mod b.$$ Once we have $w_i$
and $m_i$ we compute $v_i$ as follows: $$v_i = t\cdot b\cdot w_i +
(i-1)b+m_i.$$ But we don't need that much detail.  More simply this is, $$v_i =
O(t\cdot b \cdot w_i) = O\paren*{x_i\cdot t}.$$ Where the absorption into the
big-O notation is reasonable because $m_i < b,\,\, i<t$ so the other terms get
absorbed in the big-O notation, and we can also drop the floor and cancel the
$b$.  Note that this is the same expression we got for the conversion from
$x_i$ to $v_i$ as last time (in big-O notation).  So we once again get the same
bound on $v_{max}-v_{min}$, which doesn't actually depend on $b$, that is, with
high probability $$v_{max}-v_{min} = O(\sqrt{t\cdot n\log n}).$$

\paragraph{Summary} It is not satisfactory that this algorithm does not have
theoretical guarantees for arbitrary arrays.  We use the ideas of this
algorithm to create a new algorithm that has have theoretical guarantees on
arbitrary inputs.


%% With this optimization, one advantage of the Strided Algorithm is that when $v_{\text{max}} - v_{\text{min}}$ is small, the total number of cache misses by the algorithm is close to the same as for a single scan through the data. 

\section{Cache-Efficient Parallel Partition for \emph{Arbitrary} Input Arrays}\label{sec:smoothing}
\paragraph{The Smoothed Striding Algorithm Description}
To obtain an algorithm with provable guarantees for all inputs $A$, we
randomly perturb the internal structure of each of the $P_i$'s. Define
$U_1, \ldots, U_{g}$ (which play a role analogous to $P_1,
\ldots, P_g$ in the Strided Algorithm) so that each $U_i$ contains one
randomly selected cache line from each of $C_1, \ldots, C_{n /
  gb}$ (rather than containing the $i$-th cache line of each
$C_j$). This ensures that the number of predecessors in each $U_i$ is
a sum of independent random variables with values in $\{0, 1, \ldots,
b\}$.


By Hoeffding's Inequality, with high probability in $n$, the number of
predecessors in each $U_i$ is tightly concentrated around $\frac{\mu
  n}{g}$, where $\mu$ is the fraction of elements in $A$ that are
predecessors. It follows that, if we perform in-place partitions of
each $U_i$ in parallel, and then define $v_i$ to be the position in
$A$ of the final predecessor in (the already partitioned) $U_i$, then
the difference between $v_{\text{min}} = \min_i v_i$ and
$v_{\text{max}} = \max_i v_i$ will be small (even if the input array
$A$ is worst-case!).

Rather than partitioning $A[v_{\text{min}}],\ldots,
A[v_{\text{max}}-1]$ in serial, the Smoothed Striding Algorithm simply
recurses on the subarray. Such a recursion would not have been
productive for the original Strided Algorithm because the strided
partition $P_1', \ldots, P_g'$ used in the recursive subproblem would
satisfy $P_1' \subseteq P_1, \ldots, P_g' \subseteq P_g$ and thus each
$P_i'$ is already partitioned. That is, in the original Strided
Algorithm, the problem that we would recurse on is a worst-case input
for the algorithm in the sense that the partial partition step makes
no progress.


The main challenge in designing the Smoothed Striding Algorithm
becomes the construction of $U_1, \ldots, U_{g}$ without
violating the in-place nature of the algorithm. A natural approach
might be to store for each $U_i$ and each $C_j$ the index of the cache
line in $C_j$ that $U_i$ contains. This would require the storage of
$\Theta(n / b)$ numbers as metadata, however, preventing the algorithm
from being in-place. To save space, the key insight is to select a
random offset $X_j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, g\}$ within each $C_j$, and
then to assign the $(X_j + i \pmod g) + 1$-th cache line of $C_j$ to
$U_i$ for $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, g\}$. This allows for us to construct
the $U_i$'s using only $O\left(\frac{n}{gb}\right)$ machine words
storing the metadata $X_1, \ldots, X_{n / gb}$. By setting $g$ to
be relatively large, so that $\frac{n}{gb} \le
\operatorname{polylog}(n)$, we can obtain an in-place algorithm that
incurs $n (1 + o(1))$ cache misses.

The recursive structure of the Smoothed Striding Algorithm allows for
the algorithm to achieve polylogarithmic span. As an alternative to
recursing, one can also use Kuszmaul's in-place algorithm in order to partition \\ $A[v_{\text{min}}], \ldots,
  A[v_{\text{max}} - 1]$. This results in an improved span (since Kuszmaul's
in-place algorithm has span only $O(\log n \log \log
n)$), while still incurring only $n (1 + o(1))$ cache misses (since
Kuzmaul's cache-inefficient algorithm is only used
on a small subarray of $A$). We analyze both the recursive version of
the Smoothed Striding Algorithm, and the version which uses as a final
step Kuszmaul's in-place algorithm; one significant advantage
of the recursive version is that it is simple to implement in
practice.



%% we randomly perturb the structure of each $P_i$.


%% We now present the \defn{Smoothed Partial-Partition Algorithm}, which
%% will play a similar

%% which, like the parallel step of the Strided Algorithm, partitions subsets of the array in parallel such that partitioning the subsets and then a small subarray results in a fully partitioned array. 
%% However, unlike the parallel step of the Strided Algorithm, the Cache-Efficient Partial-Partition Algorithm has high probability guarantees on the size of the unpartitioned subarray for arbitrary inputs. 
%% The Strided Algorithm has guarantees on some inputs, for instance randomly ordered inputs, but the Cache-Efficient Partial-Partition Algorithm uses randomization in the algorithm to obviate the need for any specific type of input. 

%% Interestingly, because the Cache-Efficient Partial-Partition Algorithm has guarantees on arbitrary inputs, the Cache-Efficient Partial-Partition Algorithm can be used to partition the subarray that it generates, unlike in the Strided Algorithm where recursing with the parallel step of the Strided Algorithm would not successfully partition the subarray.
%% This is because the subarray generated in the parallel step of the Strided Algorithm is non-random in a problematic way: subsequences composed of every $t$-th element in the subarray would already be partitioned, so the parallel step of the Strided Algorithm would not change the array as it partitions these subsequences that are already partitioned, and thus could not finish the partitioning of the array.

%% The Cache-Efficient Partial-Partition Algorithm forms collections $U_y$, which are similar to the Strided Algorithm's $P_j$s, and performs a serial partition of each $U_y$ in parallel.
%% We cannot explicitly store each $U_y$, because this would require $O(n)$ memory (or $O(n/b)$ if we use indices of blocks of the array) which would make the algorithm not in-place, and eliminate the algorithm's desirable cache behavior. 
%% However, we can represent all $U_y$s with very little space by making each $U_y$ random, but not independent of other $U_{y'}$s. 

%% Our construction of $U_y$s makes it so that the fraction of predecessors in each $U_y$ will cluster closely around the fraction of predecessors in $A$.
%% The elements in each $U_y$ are spread out in $A$ so that each section of a certain size in the array will contain the same number of elements from $U_y$. 
%% Define $v_y$ to be the index of the first successor in $U_y$--this is similar to the definition of the splitting position in the Strided Algorithm.
%% Because of this uniformity in how the elements of $U_y$ are spread out, and the guarantee that the fraction of successors in each $U_y$ will cluster closely around the fraction of successors in $A$, the index $v_y$ of the first successor in collection $U_y$ will be close to all other indices $v_{y'}$.
%% This means that after each $U_y$ is partitioned, $A$ will be partially partitioned, in the sense that $A[i]$ is a predecessor for all $i < \min_y{v_y}$, and $A[i]$ is a successor for all $i \ge \max_y{v_y}$.
%% Furthermore, the size of the unpartitioned subarray $A[\min_y{v_y}],\ldots,A[\max_y{v_y}-1]$ will be very small relative to $n$. 

\paragraph{Formal Algorithm Description} Let $b < n$ be the size of a cache line, let $A$ be an input array of size
$n$, and let $g$ be a parameter. (One should think of $g$ as being
relatively large, satisfying $\frac{n}{bg} \le
\operatorname{polylog}(n)$.)  We assume for simplicity that that $n$
is divisible by $gb$, and we define $s = \frac{n}{gb}$.\footnote{This
  assumption can be made without loss of generality by treating $A$ as
  an array of size $n' = n + {(gb - n \pmod {gb})}$, and then treating
  the final $gb - n \pmod {gb}$ elements of the array as being
  successors (which consequently the algorithm needs not explicitly
  access).}

The \defn{Partial Partition Step} if the algorithm partitions the
cache lines of $A$ into $g$ sets $U_1, \ldots, U_{g}$ of size $s =
\frac{n}{gb}$ and then performs a serial partition on each of those sets
$U_i$ in parallel. To determine the sets $U_1, \ldots, U_{g}$, the
algorithm uses as metadata, an array $X = X[1], \ldots, X[s]$,
where each $X[i] \in \{1, \ldots, g\}$.

Formally, the Partial Partition Step performs the following procedure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set each of $X[1], \ldots, X[s]$ to be uniformly random and
  independently selected elements of $\{1, 2, \ldots, g\}$. For
  $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, g\}$, and for each $j \in \{1, 2,
  \ldots, s\}$, define
  $$G_i(j) = (X[j] + i \pmod g) + (j - 1)g + 1.$$ Using this
  terminology, we define each $U_i$ for $i \in \{1, \ldots, g\}$ to
  contain the $G_i(j)$-th cache line of $A$ for each $j \in \{1, 2,
  \ldots, s\}$. That is, $G_i(j)$ denotes the index of the $j$-th
  cache line from array $A$ to be contained in $U_i$.

  Note that, to compute the index of the $j$-th cache line in $U_i$,
  one needs only the value of $X[j]$. Thus the only metadata needed by
  the algorithm to determine the $U_1, \ldots, U_g$ is the array
  $X$. If $|X| = s = \frac{n}{gb} \le \operatorname{polylog}(n)$, then
  the algorithm is in place.
  
\item The algorithm performs an in-place (serial) partition on each
  $U_i$ (and performs these partitions in parallel with one
  another). In doing so, the algorithm, also collects
  $v_{\text{min}}=\min_i{v_i}$, $v_{\text{max}}=\max_i{v_i}$, where
	each $v_i$ with $i \in \{1, \ldots, g\}$ is defined to be the index
  of the final predecessor in $A$ (or $0$ if no such predecessor
  exists).\footnote{One can calculate $v_{\text{min}}$ and
    $v_{\text{max}}$ without explicitly storing each of $v_1, \ldots,
		v_{g}$ as follows. Rather than using a standard $g$-way parallel
		for-loop to partition each of $U_1, \ldots, U_{g}$, one can
    manually implement the parallel for-loop using a recursive
    divide-and-conquer approach. Each recursive call in the
    divide-and-conquer can then simply collect the maximum and minimum
    $v_i$ for the $U_i$'s that are partitioned within that recursive
    call. This adds $O(\log n)$ to the total span of the Partial
    Partition Step, which is does not affect the overall span
    asymptotically. %% In practice, this can also be implemented using
    %% CilkPlus Reducers (or OpenMP Reductions) \cite{FrigoLe09}, though
    %% empirically we have found explicitly implementing the
    %% divide-and-conquer structure to be worthwhile for performance.
  }
  
  The array $A$ is now partially partitioned, i.e. $A[i]$ is a
  predecessor for all $i \le v_{\text{min}}$, and $A[i]$ is a successor
  for all $i > v_{\text{max}}$.
\end{itemize}

The second step of the Smoothed Striding Algorithm is to complete the
partitioning of $A[v_{\text{min}} + 1], \ldots, A[v_{\text{max}}]$. This can be done
in one of two ways: The \defn{Recursive Smoothed Striding Algorithm}
partitions $A[v_{\text{min}} + 1], \ldots, A[v_{\text{max}}]$ recursively using the
same algorithm (and resorts to a serial base case when the subproblem
is small enough that $g \le O(1)$); the \defn{Hybrid Smoothed Striding
  Algorithm} partitions $A[v_{\text{min}} + 1], \ldots, A[v_{\text{max}}]$ using the
in-place algorithm given in Theorem \ref{thminplace} with span $O(\log
n \log \log n)$. In general, the Hybrid algorithm yields better
theoretical guarantees on span than the recursive version; on the
other hand, the recursive version has the advantage that is
simple to implement as fully in place, and still achieves
polylogarithmic span. We analyze both algorithms in this section.



%% note: g > s should hold
\paragraph{Algorithm Analysis} Our first proposition analyzes the Partial Partition Step.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:generalResult}
  %% The 1/2's are necessary for the final line of the proof to easily go through.
  
  Let $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$ and $\delta \in (0, 1/2)$ such that
  $\epsilon \ge \frac{1}{\poly(n)}$ and $\delta \ge
  \frac{1}{\polylog(n)}$. Suppose $s > \frac{\ln
    (n/\epsilon)}{\delta^2}$. Finally, suppose that each processor has
  a cache of size at least $s + c$ for a sufficiently large constant
  $c$.

  Then the Partial-Partition Algorithm achieves work $O(n)$; achieves
  span $O\paren*{b \cdot s}$; incurs $\frac{s+n}{b} + O(1)$ cache
  misses; and guarantees with probability $1 - \epsilon$ that
  $$v_{\text{max}}-v_{\text{min}} < 4 n \delta.$$
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
Since $\sum_i |U_i| = n$, and since the partitioning of each $U_i$
takes time $O(|U_i|)$, the total work performed by the algorithm is
$O(n)$.

Assuming that array $X$ is pinned in cache (note, in particular, that
$|X| = s \le \polylog(n)$, and so we are permitted to pin $X$ in
cache), algorithm's cache misses consist of: $n/b$ misses from
accessing each cache line of $A$; $s/b$ for instantiating the array $X$;
and $O(1)$ for other instantiating costs. This sums
to $$\frac{n+s}{b}+O(1).$$
Note, in particular, that when each cache line in $A$ is accessed, that line continues to be among the $O(1)$ most recently accessed cache lines until the final time that it is accessed, and thus does not get evicted from cache.

The span of the algorithm is $O(n/g + s) = O(b\cdot s)$, since the
each $U_i$ is of size $O(n / g)$, and because the initialization of
array $X$ can be performed in time $O(|X|) = O(s)$.

It remains to show that with probability $1-\epsilon$, $v_{\text{max}}
- v_{\text{min}} < 4n\delta$. Let $\mu$ denote the fraction of
elements in $A$ that are predecessors. For $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots,
g\}$, let $\mu_i$ denote the fraction of elements in $U_i$ that are
predecessors. Note that each $\mu_i$ is the average of $s$ independent
random variables $Y_i(1), \ldots, Y_i(s) \in [0, 1]$, where $Y_i(j)$
is the fraction of elements in the $G_i(j)$-th cache line of $A$ that
are predecessors. By construction, $G_i(j)$ has the same probability
distribution for all $i$, since $(X[j] + i) \pmod g$ is uniformly
random in $\mathbb{Z}_g$ for all $i$. It follows that $Y_i(j)$ has the
same distribution for all $i$, and thus that $\E[\mu_i]$ is
independent of $i$. Since the average of the $\mu_i$s is $\mu$, it
follows that $\E[\mu_i] = \mu$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, g\}$.

Since each $\mu_i$ is the average of $s$ independent $[0, 1]$-random
variables, we can apply Hoeffding's inequality (i.e. a Chernoff Bound
for a random variable on $[0,1]$ rather than on $\{0,1\}$) to each
$\mu_i$ to show that it is tightly concentrated around its expected
value $\mu$, i.e.,
$$\Pr[|\mu_i - \mu| \geq \delta] < 2\exp(-2s\delta^2). $$

Since $s > \frac{\ln (n/\epsilon)}{\delta^2} \ge \frac{\ln (2n / (b\epsilon))}{2\delta^2}$, we find that for all $i \in
\{1,\ldots, g\}$,
$$\Pr[|\mu_i - \mu| \geq \delta] < 2\exp\Big({-2} \frac{\ln
  (2n/(b\epsilon))}{2\delta^2} \delta^2\Big) = \frac{\epsilon}{n/b} <
\frac{\epsilon}{g}. $$ By the union bound, it follows that with
probability at least $1 - \epsilon$, all of $\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_{g}$ are within $\delta$ of $\mu$.

%% We use this bound on the probability of any individual group $U_y$ failing to meet the condition $|\mu-\mu_y| < \delta$ to bound the probability that at least one of the groups $U_0, \ldots, U_{g-1}$ fails to meet the condition.
%% Note that the probability of at least one group failing is: 
%% $$\Pr\Big[\bigvee_{y=0}^{g-1} |\mu_y - \mu| \geq \delta\Big].$$
%% This is bounded by 
%% $$\Pr\Big[\bigvee_{y=0}^{g-1} |\mu_y - \mu| \geq \delta\Big] \leq \sum_{y=0}^{g-1} \Pr[|\mu_y - \mu| \geq \delta] < \epsilon.$$
%% Thus the event occurs with probability bounded above by $\epsilon$, the specified failure probability.


To complete the proof we will show that the occurrence of the event
that all $y$ simultaneously satisfy $|\mu - \mu_y| < \delta$ implies
that $v_{\text{max}} - v_{\text{min}} \le 4n\delta$.

%% Let $U_i(j)$ denote the index in $A$ of the $j$-th element in
%% $U_i$.satisfies
%% $$gj - bg + 1 \le U_i(j) \le gj + bg$$ for all $j$.

%% It follows
%% that $v_i = U_i(\mu_i \cdot |U_i|)$ is within $bg$ of $g
%% \mu_j \cdot |U_i| = \mu_j n$. Therefore,
%% $$|v_i - \mu n| \le bg + (\mu_j - \mu) n < bg + \delta n.$$ This
%% implies that the maximum of $|v_i - v_j|$ for
%% any $i$ and $j$ is at most, $2bg + 2\delta n$. Thus,
%% \begin{align*}
%%   v_{\text{max}} - v_{\text{min}} & \le 2n \left( \delta + \frac{n}{bg} \right)  = 2n \left( \delta + s \right) \\
%%   & \le 2n \left(\delta + \frac{2\delta^2}{\ln (2n / (b\epsilon))}\right) < 4n\cdot\delta.
%% \end{align*}


  Recall that $G_i(j)$ denotes the index within $A$ of the $j$ th cache-line contained in $U_i$. By the definition of $G_i(j)$, $$(j - 1)g + 1 \le G_i(j) \le jg.$$ Note that $A[v_i]$ will occur in the $\lceil s\mu_i \rceil$-th cache-line of $U_i$ because $U_i$ is composed of $s$ cache lines. Hence $$(\lceil s\mu_i \rceil - 1) g b + 1 \le v_i \le \lceil s\mu_i \rceil g b,$$
  which means that
  $$s\mu_i g b - gb - 1 \le v_i \le s\mu_i g b + gb.$$ Since $sgb =
  n$, it follows that $|v_i - n \mu_i| \le gb$. Therefore,
  $$|v_i - n \mu| < gb + n\delta.$$
  This
implies that the maximum of $|v_i - v_j|$ for
any $i$ and $j$ is at most, $2bg + 2\delta n$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
  v_{\text{max}} - v_{\text{min}} & \le 2n \left( \delta + \frac{n}{bg} \right)  = 2n \left( \delta + s \right) \\
  & \le 2n \left(\delta + \frac{2\delta^2}{\ln (2n / (b\epsilon))}\right) < 4n\cdot\delta.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

We will use Proposition \ref{prop:generalResult} as a tool to analyze the Recursive and the Hybrid Smoothed Striding Algorithms.

Rather than parameterizing the Partial Partition step in each algorithm by $s$, Proposition \ref{prop:generalResult} suggests that it is more natural to parameterize by $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, which then determine $s$.

We will assume that both the hybrid and the recursive algorithms use $\epsilon = 1/n^c$ for $c$ of our choice (i.e. with high probability in $n$). Moreover, the Recursive Smoothed Striding Algorithm continues to use the same value of $\epsilon$ within recursive subproblems (i.e., the $\epsilon$ is chosen based on the size of the first subproblem in the recursion), that way the entire algorithm succeeds with high probability in $n$.

For both algorithms, the choice of $\delta$ results in a tradeoff between cache misses and span. For the Recursive algorithm, we allow for $\delta$ to be chosen arbitrarily at the top level of recursion, and then fix $\delta  = \Theta(1)$ to be a sufficiently small constant at all levels of recursion after the first; this guarantees that we at least halve the size of the problem size between recursive iterations\footnote{In general, setting $\delta = 1/8$ will result in the problem size being halved. However, this relies on the assumption that $gb \mid n$, which is only without loss of generality by allowing for the size of subproblems to be sometimes artificially increased by a small amount (i.e., a factor of $1 + gb / n = 1 + 1/s$). One can handle this issue by decreasing $\delta$ to, say, $1/16$.}. Optimizing $\delta$ further (after the first level of recursion) would only affect the number of undesired cache misses by a constant factor.


%% $\delta = 1/8$ in order to at least halve the size of the problem size at each iteration. 
%% % Using this higher value of $\delta$ is ok because the lower levels of recursion are small, so it doesn't matter a lot what you do with them.


Next we analyze the Hybrid Smoothed Striding Algorithm.
\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:fullPartition}
	The Hybrid Smoothed Striding Algorithm algorithm using parameter $\delta\in(0,1/2)$ satisfying $\delta \ge 1/\polylog(n)$: has work $O(n)$; achieves span
        $$O\paren*{\log n \log\log n +\frac{b\log n}{\delta^2}},$$
with high probability in $n$; and incurs fewer than 
$$(n+O(n\delta))/b$$
cache misses with high probability in $n$.
\end{theorem}

%% note: b/loglogn > 1 in reality, but the constant factors make it so that delta is still < 1

An interesting corollary of the above theorem concerns what happens when $b$ is small (e.g., constant) and we choose $\delta$ to optimize span. 

%% This can be done with an extreme setting of $\delta$.
%% This is interesting because it shows that it is possible to achie
%%ve low span along with a small number of cache misses.
\begin{corollary}[Corollary of Theorem \ref{thm:fullPartition}]
	\label{cor:fullPartition}
Suppose $b \le o(\log \log n)$. Then the Cache-Efficient Full-Partition Algorithm algorithm using $\delta = \Theta\big(\sqrt{b/\log\log n}\big)$, achieves work $O(n)$, and with high probability in $n$, achieves span $O(\log n \log\log n)$ and incurs fewer than $(n+o(n))/b$ cache misses.\\\\
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:fullPartition}]
  
  We analyze the Partial Partition Step using Proposition
  \ref{prop:generalResult}. Note that by our choice of $\epsilon$,
  $s=O\left(\frac{\log n}{\delta^2}\right)$.  The Partial Partition
  Step therefore has work $O(n)$, span $O\paren*{\frac{b\log
      n}{\delta^2}},$ and incurs fewer than
	$$\frac{n}{b}+O\paren*{\frac{\log n}{b\delta^2}}+O(1)$$ 
  cache misses.

  The subproblem of partitioning $A[v_{\text{min}} + 1], \ldots,
   A[v_{\text{max}}]$ takes work $O(n)$. With high probability in $n$,
  the subproblem has size less than $4n\delta$, which means that the subproblem
  achieves span
  $$O(\log n\delta \log\log n\delta) = O(\log n \log\log n),$$
  and incurs at most $O(n \delta / b)$ cache misses.

  The total number of cache misses is therefore,
  	$$\frac{n}{b}+O\paren*{\frac{\log n}{b\delta^2} +
    \frac{n\delta}{b}}+O(1),$$ which since $\delta \ge 1 /
  \polylog(n)$, is at most $(n+O(n\delta))/b + O(1) \le (n + O(n
  \delta)) / b,$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary \ref{cor:fullPartition}] We use $\delta = \sqrt{b/\log\log n}$ in the result proved in Theorem \ref{thm:fullPartition}. \\
	First note that the assumptions of Theorem \ref{thm:fullPartition} are satisfied because $O(\sqrt{b/\log\log n}) > 1 / \polylog(n).$
	The algorithm achieves work $O(n)$. 
	With high probability in $n$ the algorithm achieves span 
	$$O\paren*{\log n \log\log n +\frac{b\log n}{\delta^2}} = O(\log n\log\log n).$$
	With high probability in $n$ the algorithm incurs fewer than 
	$$(n+O(n\delta))/b = (n+O(n\sqrt{b/\log\log n}))/b$$ 
	cache misses.
	By assumption $\sqrt{b/\log\log n} = o(1)$, so this reduces to 
	$(n+o(n))/b$
	cache misses, as desired.
	%% explain why span and cache behavior are very good? (kind of already did before, but reiterating probably doesn't hurt...)
\end{proof}


%%% Should make the distinction between n and the array size of subproblems more clear?
%%% n always refers to the size of the top level
%%% 2^{-i} delta n refers to an upper bound on the size of a subproblem

The next theorem analyzes the span of the Recursive Smoothed Striding Algorithm.
\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:groupedPartitionAlg}
	With high probability in $n$, the Recursive Smoothed Striding
        algorithm using parameter $\delta \in(0,1/2)$ satisfying
        $\delta \ge 1 / \polylog(n)$: achieves work $O(n)$, attains span
	$$O\left(b\left(\log^2 n + \frac{\log n}{\delta^2}\right)\right),$$
	and incurs $(n+O(n \delta))/b$ cache misses. 
\end{theorem}

A particularly natural parameter setting for the Recursive algorithm occurs at $\delta = 1 / \sqrt{\log n}$.
\begin{corollary}[Corollary of Theorem \ref{thm:groupedPartitionAlg}]
  \label{cor:groupedPartitionAlg}
	With high probability in $n$, the Recursive Smoothed Striding Algorithm using parameter $\delta=1/\sqrt{\log n}$:
  achieves work $O(n)$, attains span $O(b\log^2 n)$, and incurs $n/b \cdot (1 + O(1 / \sqrt{\log n}))$ cache misses. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:groupedPartitionAlg}]
  To avoid confusion, we use $\delta'$, rather than $\delta$, to
  denote the constant value of $\delta$ used at levels of recursion
  after the first.
  
  
  By Theorem \ref{prop:generalResult}, the top level of the algorithm
  has work $O(n)$, span $O\Big(b\frac{\log n}{\delta^2}\Big),$ and
  incurs $\frac{s+n}{b} + O(1)$ cache misses.  The recursion reduces
  the problem size by at least a factor of $4\delta$, with high
  probability in $n$.

  At lower layers of recursion, with high probability in $n$, the
  algorithm reduces the problem size by a factor of at least
  $1/2$ (since $\delta$ is set to be a sufficiently small
  constant). For each $i > 1$, it follows that the size of the problem at the $i$-th level of recursion is at most $O(n \delta / 2^i)$.
  
  The sum of the sizes of the problems after the first level of
  recursion is therefore a geometric series summing to at most $O(n
  \delta)$. This means that the total work of the algorithm is at most
  $O(n\delta) + O(n) \le O(n)$.

  Recall that each level $i > 1$ uses $s =
  \frac{\ln(2^{-i}n\delta'/b)}{\delta'^2}$, where $\delta' =
  \Theta(1)$. It follows that level $i$ uses $s \le O(\log n)$.  Thus,
  by Proposition \ref{prop:generalResult}, level $i$ contributes
  $O(b\cdot s)=O(b \log n)$ to the span.  Since there are at most  $O(\log n)$ levels of recursion, the total span in the lower levels
  of recursion is at most $O(b\log^2 n)$, and the total span for the
  algorithm is at most,
	$$O\left(b\left(\log^2 n + \frac{\log n}{\delta^2}\right)\right).$$
        
	To compute the total number of cache misses of the algorithm,
        we add together $(n+s)/b+O(1)$ for the top level, and then, by
        Proposition \ref{prop:generalResult}, at most
	$$\sum_{0 \leq i< O(\log n)}\frac{1}{b} O\paren*{2^{2-i}n\delta + \log n} \le O\left(\frac{1}{b} (n \delta + \log^2 n)\right).$$
	for lower levels.
	Thus the total number of cache misses for the algorithm is, 
	$$\frac{1}{b}\left(n+\frac{\log n}{\delta^2 }\right) + O(n\delta + \log^2 n) / b = (n+O(n\delta))/b.$$
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary \ref{cor:groupedPartitionAlg}] By Theorem \ref{thm:groupedPartitionAlg}, with high probability in $n$, the algorithm has work $O(n)$, the algorithm has span
	$$O\left(b\left(\log^2 n + \frac{\log
    n}{\delta^2}\right)\right) = O(\log^2 n),$$ and the algorithm
  incurs
	$$(n+O(n\delta))/b = (n+O(n/\sqrt{\log n}))/b = (n+o(n))/b$$ 
	cache misses.
\end{proof}

% In addition to these desirable theoretical guarantees, these algorithms performs well in practice, as shown in the experimental section.
% Also, because the Cache-Efficient Partial-Partition Algorithm achieves an optimal number of cache misses up to lower order terms, its bandwidth bound is optimal.

\section{Performance Comparisons}\label{secexp}

In this section, we implement the Smoothed-Striding algorithm and compare its performance to that of previously developed algorithms.
This demonstrates the practical importance of our guarantees on cache-misses, and also demonstrates that our guarantees do not come at a large performance loss compared to the Blocked Strided Algorithm which lacks these guarantees.

Each implementation considers an array of $n$ 64-bit integers, and
partitions them based on a pivot. The integers in the array are
initially generated so that each is randomly either larger or smaller
than the pivot.


%%% OUTLINE:
%% speedup
%% slowdown
%% memory bandwidth
%%% speed up quicksort

% We show the speedup of the algorithms over serial partition, we show the slowdown over serial partition when the parallel algorithms are given a single thread, and we show how the memory bandwidth bound is a performance bottleneck for non-cache efficient algorithms.
We compare the following 5 partition algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \defn{Serial:} The serial partition algorithm algorithm serves as a baseline that we use to measure performance of parallel algorithms. 
	\item \defn{High-Space:} The standard out-of-place parallel prefix sum based algorithm \footnote{The optimization of reducing the prefix-sum by a factor of $O(\log n)$ at the top level of recursion, rather than simply by a factor of two, can also be applied to the standard parallel-prefix algorithm when constructing a prefix-sum array of size $n$. Even without the space reduction, this reduces the (constant) overhead in the parallel prefix sum, while keeping the overall span of the parallel-prefix operation at $O(\log n)$. We perform this optimization in the high-space implementation.}
	\item \defn{Low-Space:} Kusmzaul's in-place parallel prefix sum based algorithm. \footnote{The low-space implementation still uses a small amount of auxiliary memory for the parallel-prefix, storing every $O(\log n)$-th element of the parallel-prefix array explicitly rather than using the implicit-storage approach originally developed by Kuszmaul. Nonetheless the space consumption is several orders of magnitude smaller than the original algorithm.}
	\item \defn{Blocked Strided:} The Blocked Strided algorithm which only has guarantees for certain inputs such as random inputs. \footnote{Note that we do not test this algorithm with inputs that we know to be adversarial to it.}
	\item \defn{Smoothed Striding:} The algorithm we developed in this paper which adds randomization to the Blocked Strided algorithm's internal structure to obviate the need for specific inputs.
\end{itemize}
We show that the algorithms which achieve space-reduction over the standard parallel partition algorithm achieve better cache-behavior which allows for it to achieve a speedup.
We show that the High-Space and Low-Space algorithms are bottlenecked by memory throughput and that the Blocked Strided and Smoothed-Striding algorithms are not bottlenecked by memory throughput.
The cache efficiency of the Blocked Strided and Smoothed Striding algorithm allows them to avoid the memory bandwidth bound and achieve substantially better scaling than the parallel-prefix-based parallel partition algorithms.
The Strided Algorithm tends to slightly outperform the Smoothed Striding Algorithm, though on 18 threads their performance is within 15\% of one-another. We conclude that the Smoothed Striding Algorithm allows for one to obtain empirical performance comparable to that of the Strided Algorithm, while simultaneously achieving the provable guarantees on span and cache-efficiency missing from the original Strided Algorithm.

% In Subsection \ref{subsecstrided}, we evaluate the performance of the
% Recursive Smoothed Striding Algorithm and the Strided Algorithms. The
% cache efficiency of the two algorithms allows for them to achieve
% substantially better scaling than their parallel-prefix-based
% counterparts. The Strided Algorithm tends to slightly outperform the
% Smoothed Striding Algorithm, though on 18 threads their performance is
% within 15\% of one-another. We conclude that the Smoothed Striding
% Algorithm allows for one to obtain empirical performance comparable to
% that of the Strided Algorithm, while simultaneously achieving the
% provable guarantees on span and cache-efficiency missing from the
% original Strided Algorithm.


%% In Subsection \ref{subsechighspan}, we present a fourth
%% parallel-partition algorithm which we call the \defn{two-layer
%%   algorithm}, and which runs fully in place but has a polynomial span
%% of $\Theta(\sqrt{n \log n})$. The polynomial span of the algorithm
%% makes it so that a naive implementation performs poorly. Nonetheless,
%% we show that by tuning the algorithm to the number of worker threads,
%% further speedup can often be achieved over the low-space algorithm.

%% The two-layer algorithm has the advantage that is very simple to
%% implement, and runs in serial at almost the same speed as GNU Libc
%% quicksort's serial algorithm. On the other hand the algorithm's
%% performance is much more sensitive to input size and number of cores
%% than is the low-space implementation. On a machine with sufficiently
%% many cores (and sufficiently large memory bandwidth), the
%% polylogarithmic span of the low-space implementation is desirable.


\paragraph{Machine Details}
Our experiments are performed on a two-socket machine with eighteen
2.9 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 processors. To maximize the memory
bandwidth of the machine, we use a NUMA memory-placement policy in
which memory allocation is spread out evenly across the nodes of the
machine; this is achieved using the \emph{interleave=all} option in
the Linux \emph{numactl} tool \cite{Kleen05}. Worker threads in our
experiments are each given their own core, with hyperthreading
disabled.

Our algorithms are implemented using the CilkPlus task parallelism
library in C++. The implementations avoid the use of concurrency
mechanisms and atomic operations, but do allow for concurrent reads to
be performed on shared values such as $n$ and the pointer to the input
array. Our code is compiled using g++ 7.3.0, with \emph{march=native}
and at optimization level three. 

Our implementations are available at \github.


\paragraph{Implementation Details}
In each implementation, the parallelism is achieved through simple
parallel-for-loops, with one exception at the beginning of the
low-space implementation, when the number of predecessors in the input
array is computed. Although CilkPlus Reducers (or OpenMP Reductions)
could be used to perform this parallel summation within a
parallel-for-loop \cite{FrigoLe09}, we found a slightly more ad-hoc
approach to be faster: Using a simple recursive structure, we manually
implemented a parallel-for-loop with Cilk Spawns and Syncs, allowing
for the summation to be performed within the recursion.



% In this section, we compare four partition implementations,
% incorporating the techniques from Section \ref{secalg} in order to
% achieve space efficiency:
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin = .15in]
% \item \emph{A Serial Baseline:} This uses the serial in-place
%   partition implementation from GNU Libc quicksort, with minor
%   adaptions to optimize it for the case of sorting 64-bit integers
%   (i.e., inlining the comparison function, etc.).
% \item \emph{The High-Space Parallel Implementation:} This uses the
%   standard parallel partition algorithm \cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16}, as
%   described in Section \ref{secprelim}. The space overhead is roughly
%   $2n$ eight-byte words.
% \item \emph{The Medium-Space Parallel Implementation:} Starting with
%   the high-space implementation, we reduce the space used by the
%   Parallel-Prefix phase by only constructing every $O(\log n)$-th
%   element of the prefix-sum array $B$, as in Section
%   \ref{secalg}. (Here $O(\log n)$ is hard-coded as 64.) The array $B$
%   is initialized to be of size $n / 64$, with each component equal to
%   a sum of 64 elements, and then a parallel prefix sum is computed on
%   the array $B$. Rather than implicitly encoding the elements of $B$ in
%   $A$, we use an auxiliary array of size $n / 64$ to explicitly store
%   the prefix sums.

  %% \footnote{We suspect that an implementation in which
  %%   the values are implicitly stored could also be made fast. In
  %%   particular, the value 64 can be increased to compensate for
  %%   whatever constant overhead is induced by the implicit storage of
  %%   values. Nonetheless, the auxiliary array is already quite small
  %%   relative to the input and is more practical to implement.}
%   The algorithm
%   has a space overhead of $\frac{n}{32} + n$ eight-byte
%   words.\footnote{In addition to the auxiliary array of size $n / 64$,
%     we use a series of smaller arrays of sizes $n / 128, n / 256,
%     \ldots$ in the recursive computation of the prefix sum. The
%     alternative of performing the parallel-prefix sum in place, as in
%     Section \ref{secalg}, tends to be less cache-friendly in
%     practice.}
% \item \emph{The Low-Space Parallel Implementation:}
% Starting with the medium-space implementation, we make the reordering
% phase completely in-place using the preprocessing technique in Section
% \ref{secalg}.\footnote{Depending on whether the majority of elements
%   are predecessors are successors, the algorithm goes down separate
%   (but symmetric) code paths. In our timed experiments we test only
%   with inputs containing more predecessors than successors, since this
%   the slower of the two cases (by a very slight amount) for our
%   implementation.} The only space overhead in this implementation is
% the $\frac{n}{32}$ additional 8-byte words used in the prefix sum.
% \end{itemize}

%% All three parallel-implementations have work $O(n)$ The high- and
%% medium- space implementations have span $O(\log n)$, while the
%% low-space implementation has span $O(\log^2 n)$ (due to the fact that
%% for convenience of implementation parallel-for-loops are broken into
%% chunks of size $64 = O(\log n)$).

% We remark that the ample parallelism of the low-space algorithm makes
% it so that for large inputs the value $64$ can easily be increased
% substantially without negatively effecting algorithm performance. For
% example, on an input of size $2^{28}$, increasing it to $4096$ has
% essentially no effect on the empirical runtime while bringing the
% auxiliary space-consumption down to a $\frac{1}{2048}$-fraction of the
% input size. (In fact, the increase from 64 to 4096 results in roughly
% a 5\% speedup.)

\paragraph{Space-Optimization Performance Gains}
Figure \ref{tablecilk} graphs the speedup of the each of the parallel
algorithms over the serial algorithm, using varying numbers of worker
threads on an 18-core machine with a fixed input size of $n =
2^{30}$. All space optimizations result in performance improvements, with the
low-space implementation performing almost four times as well as the high-space
implementation on eighteen threads. %% Similar speedups are
%% achieved on smaller inputs; see Figure \ref{tablecilk2}, which graphs
%% speedup for input sizes starting at $2^{23}$.

Figure \ref{tableserial} compares the performances of the
implementations in serial. Parallel-for-loops are replaced with serial
for-loops to eliminate scheduler overhead. As the input-size varies,
the ratios of the runtimes vary only slightly. The low-space
implementation performs within a factor of roughly 1.9 of the serial
implementation. As in Figure \ref{tablecilk},
all space optimizations result in performance improvements.

\paragraph{The Source of the Speedup}
% If we compare the number of instructions performed by the three
% parallel implementations, then the medium-space algorithm would seem
% to be the clear winner. Using Cachegrind to profile the number of
% instructions performed in a (serial) execution on an input of size
% $2^{28}$,\footnote{This smaller problem size is used to compensate for the fact that Cachegrind can be somewhat slow.} the high-space, medium-space, and low-space implementations
% perform 4.4 billion, 2.9 billion, and 4.6 billion instructions,
% respectively.

% Cache misses tell a different story, however.
Using Cachegrind to profile the number of top-level cache misses in a (serial) execution
on an input of size $2^{28}$, the high-space and
low-space implementations incur 305 million and 124
million cache misses respectively.

To a first approximation, the number of cache misses by each algorithm
is proportional to the number of times that the algorithm scans
through a large array. By eliminating the use of large auxiliary
arrays, the low-space implementation has the opportunity to achieve a
reduction in the number of such scans. Additionally, the low-space
algorithm allows for steps from adjacent phases of the algorithm to
sometimes be performed in the same pass. For example, the enumeration
of the number of predecessors and the top level of the Preprocessing
phase can be performed together in a single pass on the input
array. Similarly, the later levels of the Preprocessing phase (which
focus on only one half of the input array) can be combined with the
construction of (one half of) the auxiliary array used in the Parallel
Prefix Sum phase, saving another half of a pass.


%% There are additional slightly more tricky potential optimizations
%% that we did not make. One could, for example, also combine the
%% construction of the other half of the auxiliary array used in the
%% Parallel Prefix Sum Phase with the top level of the Preprocessing
%% Phase; this is made more subtle by the fact that when performing the
%% top level of the Preprocessing Phase, we do not know yet whether we
%% will be recursing on the left or right half of the array. One could
%% also implement the later levels of the Preprocessing Phase to have a
%% more cache-friendly recursive structure, starting with the final step
%% of the Preprocessing Phase and recursively working backwords to
%% perform the entire phase in a depth-first recursive tree. Evaluating
%% these optimizations would be an interesting direction of future work.

\paragraph{The Memory-Bandwidth Limitation}
The comparison of cache misses suggests that performance is
bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. To evaluate whether this is the
case, we measure for each $t \in \{1, \ldots, 18\}$ the memory
throughput of $t$ threads attempting to scan through disjoint portions
of a large array in parallel. We measure two types of bandwidth, the
\defn{read-bandwidth}, in which the threads are simply trying to read
from the array, and the \defn{read/write bandwidth}, in which the
threads are attempting to immediately overwrite entries to the array
after reading them. Given read-bandwidth $r$ bytes/second and
read/write bandwidth $w$ bytes/second, the time needed for the
low-space algorithm to perform its memory operations on an input of
$m$ bytes will be roughly $3.5 m / w + .5m / r$ seconds. We call this
the \defn{bandwidth constraint}. No matter how optimized the
implementation of the low-space algorithm is, the bandwidth constraint
serves as a hard lower bound for the running
time.\footnote{Empirically, on an array of size $n = 2^{28}$, the total number of cache misses is within
  $8\%$ of what this assumption would predict, suggesting that the
  bandwidth constraint is within a small amount of the true
  bandwidth-limited runtime.}

Figure \ref{tablebandwidth} compares the time taken by the low-space
algorithm to the bandwidth constraint as the number of threads $t$
varies from $1$ to $18$. As the number of threads grows, the algorithm
becomes bandwidth limited, achieving its best possible parallel
performance on the machine. The algorithm scales particularly well on
the first socket of the machine, achieving a speedup on nine cores of
roughly six times better than its performance on a single core, and
then scales more poorly on the second socket as it becomes
bottlenecked by memory bandwidth.


\paragraph{Comparing the Smoothed Striding and Strided Algorithms} 

We now consider the performance of the Strided Algorithm
and the Recursive Smoothed Striding Algorithm. Past work
\cite{Frias08} found that, on large numbers of threads, the Strided
Algorithm has performance close to that of other non-EREW state-of-the
art partition algorithms (i.e., within 20\% of the best
atomic-operation based algorithms). The Strided Algorithm does not
offer provable guarantees on span and cache-efficiency, however; and
indeed, the reason that the algorithm cannot recurse on the subarray
$A[v_{\text{min}} + 1], \ldots, A[v_{\text{max}}]$ is that the subarray has been
implicitly constructed to be worst-case for the algorithm. In this
subsection, we show that, with only a small loss in performance, the
Smoothed Striding Algorithm can be used to achieve provable guarantees
on arbitrary inputs. We remark that we do not make any attempt to
generate worst-case inputs for the Strided Algorithm (in fact the
random inputs that we use are among the only inputs for which the
Strided Algorithm does exhibit provable guarantees!).

Figures \ref{tableserial} and \ref{tablecilk} evaluate the performance
of the Smoothed Striding and Strided Algorithms in serial and in
parallel. On a single thread, the Smoothed Striding and Strided
Algorithms perform approximately 1.5 times slower than the Libc-based
serial implementation baseline. When executed on multiple threads, the
performances of the Smoothed Striding and Strided Algorithms scale
close to linearly in the number of threads. On 18 threads, the
Smoothed Striding Algorithm achieves a $9.6 \times $ speedup over the
Libc-based Serial Baseline, and the Strided Algorithm achieves an
$11.1 \times$ speedup over the same baseline.

The nearly-ideal scaling of the two algorithms can be explained by
their cache behavior. Whereas the parallel-prefix-based algorithms
were bottlenecked by memory bandwidth, Figure \ref{tablebandwidth}
shows that the same is no longer true for the Smoothed Striding
Algorithm. The figure compares the performance of the Smoothed
Striding Algorithm to the minimum time needed simple to read and overwrite
each entry of the input array using $18$ concurrent threads without any other
computation (i.e., the memory bandwidth constraint). On 18 threads, the time required by the memory bandwidth
constraint constitutes $58\%$ of the algorithm's total running time.

\paragraph{NUMA Effects}
We remark that the use of the Linux \emph{numactl} tool \cite{Kleen05}
to spread memory allocation evenly across the nodes of the machine is
necessary to prevent the Smoothed Striding Algorithm and the Strided
Algorithm from being bandwidth limited. For example, if we replicate
the 18-thread column of Figure \ref{tablebandwidth} without using
\emph{numactl}, then the speedup of the Smoothed Striding Algorithm is
8.2, whereas the memory-bandwidth bound for maximum possible speedup
is only slightly larger at $10.2$.


\paragraph{Implementation Details} Both algorithms use $b = 512$. The Smoothed Striding Algorithm uses
slightly tuned $\epsilon, \delta$ parameters similar to those outlined
in Corollary \ref{cor:groupedPartitionAlg}. Although $v_{\text{min}}$
and $v_{\text{max}}$ could be computed using CilkPlus Reducers
\cite{FrigoLe09}, we found it advantageous to instead manually
implement the parallel-for-loop  in the Partial Partition step with Cilk Spawns and Syncs, and to
compute $v_{\text{min}}$ and $v_{\text{max}}$ within the recursion.

\paragraph{Example Application: A Full Quicksort}
In Figure \ref{tablesort}, we graph the performance of a parallel
quicksort implementation using the low-space parallel-prefix-based
algorithm, the Smoothed Striding Algorithm, and the Strided
Algorithm. We compare the algorithm performances 
with varying numbers of worker threads and input sizes to GNU Libc quicksort; the input
array is initially in a random permutation.

Our parallel quicksort uses the parallel-partition algorithm at the
top levels of recursion, and then swaps to the serial-partitioning
algorithm once the input size has been reduced by at least a factor of
$8p$, where $p$ is the number of worker threads. By using the
serial-partitioning algorithm on the small recursive subproblems we
avoid the overhead of the parallel algorithm, while still achieving
parallelism between subproblems. Small recursive problems also exhibit
better cache behavior than larger ones, reducing the effects of
memory-bandwidth limitations on the performance of the parallel
quicksort, and further improving the scaling.



%% \subsection{An In-Place Algorithm with Polynomial Span}\label{subsechighspan}

%% In this subsection, we consider a simple in-place parallel-partition
%% algorithm with polynomial span. We evaluate the algorithm as a simple
%% and even-lower-overhead alternative to the low-space algorithm in the
%% previous subsection.

%% The algorithm takes two steps:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item \textbf{Step 1:} The algorithm breaks the input array $A$ into
%%   $t$ equal-sized parts, $P_1, \ldots, P_t$, for some parameter $t$. A
%%   serial partition is performed on each of the $P_i$'s in
%%   parallel. This step takes work $\Theta(n)$ and span $\Theta(n / t)$.
%% \item \textbf{Step 2:} The algorithm loops in serial through each of
%%   the $t$ parts $P_1, \ldots, P_t$. Upon visiting $P_i$, the algorithm
%%   has already performed a complete partition on the subarray $P_1
%%   \circ \cdots \circ P_{i - 1}$. Let $j$ denote the number of
%%   predecessors in $P_1, \ldots, P_{i - 1}$, and $k$ denote the number
%%   of predecessors in $P_i$. The algorithm computes $k$ through a
%%   simple binary search in $P_i$. The algorithm then moves the $k$
%%   elements at the start of $P_i$ to take the place of the $k$ elements
%%   $A[j + 1], \ldots, A[j + k]$. If the two sets of $k$ elements are
%%   disjoint, then they are swapped with one-another in a
%%   parallel-for-loop; otherwise, the non-overlapping portions of the
%%   two sets of $k$ elements are swapped in parallel, while the
%%   overlapping portion is left untouched. This completes the
%%   partitioning of the parts $P_1 \circ \cdots \circ P_i$. Performing
%%   this step for $i = 1, \ldots, t$ requires work $O(t \log n + n)$ and
%%   span $\Theta(t \log n)$.
%% \end{itemize}

%% Setting $t = \sqrt{n}$, the algorithm runs in linear time with span
%% $\sqrt{n} \log n$; refining $t$ to an optimal value of $\sqrt{n / \log
%%   n}$ results a span of $\sqrt{n \log n}$. In practice,
%% however, this leaves too little parallelism in the parallel-for-loops
%% in Step 2, resulting in poor scaling.\footnote{On 18 threads an on an
%%   input of size $2^{28}$, for example, setting $t = \sqrt{n}$ results
%%   in a performance a factor of two slower than the low-space
%%   implementation, and setting $t = \sqrt{n / \log n}$ makes only
%%   partial progress towards closing that gap.} To mitigate this, we
%% tune our implementation of the algorithm to the number of processors
%% $p$ on which it is being run, setting $t = 8 \cdot p$, in order to
%% maximize the parallelism in the for-loops in Step 2, while still
%% providing sufficient parallelism for Step 1.

%% Figures \ref{tablecilk} and \ref{tablecilk2} compare the parallel
%% performance of the algorithm, which is referred to as the
%% \defn{two-layer algorithm}, to its lower-span peers. On 18 cores and
%% on an input of size $2^{28}$, the two-layer algorithm offers a speedup of
%% roughly 50\% over the low-space algorithm. The algorithm is more
%% sensitive to input-size and number of cores, however, requiring a
%% large enough ratio between the two to compensate for the algorithm's
%% large span (See Figure \ref{tablecilk2}).

%% Figure \ref{tableserial} compares the performance of the two-layer
%% algorithm in serial to GNU Libc quicksort. The algorithm runs within a
%% small fraction (less than $1/4$) of the serial implementation.

%% Figure \ref{tablebandwidth} evaluates the degree to which the
%% algorithm is memory-bandwidth bound on an input of size $2^{28}$. If
%% the read/write bandwidth of the algorithm is $w$ bytes/second, then
%% the bandwidth constraint for the algorithm on an input of $m$ bytes is
%% given by $2m / w$. In particular, Step 1 of the algorithm makes one
%% scan through the array, requiring time $m / w$; and then Step 2
%% rearranges the predecessors (which constitute half of the array and
%% each must be moved to a new location), requiring additional time $m /
%% w$. Figure \ref{tablebandwidth} compares the time taken by the
%% algorithm to the bandwidth constraint as the number of threads $t$
%% varies from $1$ to $18$. Like the low-space algorithm, as the number
%% of threads grows, the algorithm becomes close to bandwidth limited.

%% Figure \ref{tablesort} compares the performance of a quicksort
%% implementation using the two-layer partition algorithm, to the
%% performance of an implementation using the low-space algorithm. The
%% implementation using the two-layer algorithm achieves a modest speedup
%% over the low-space algorithm, but also demonstrates its larger span by
%% suffering on smaller inputs as the number of cores grows.


\section{Conclusion and Open Questions}

Parallel partition is a fundamental primitive in parallel algorithms
\cite{Blelloch96,AcarBl16}. Achieving faster and more space-efficient
implementations, even by constant factors, is therefore of high
practical importance. Until now, the only space-efficient algorithms
for parallel partition have relied extensively on concurrency
mechanisms or atomic operations, or lacked provable performance
guarantees. If a parallel function is going to invoked within a large
variety of applications, then provable guarantees are highly
desirable. Moreover, algorithms that avoid the use of concurrency
mechanisms tend to scale more reliably (and with less dependency on
the particulars of the underlying hardware).

In this paper, we have shown that, somewhat surprisingly, one can
adapt the classic parallel algorithm to completely eliminate the use
of auxiliary memory, while still using only exclusive read/write
shared variables, and maintaining a polylogarithmic span. Although the
superior cache performance of the low-space algorithm results in
practical speedups over its out-of-place counterpart, both algorithms
remain far from the state-of-the art due to memory bandwidth bottlenecks. To close this gap, we also
presented a second in-place algorithm, the Smoothed Striding
Algorithm, which achieves polylogarithmic span while guaranteeing
provably optimal cache performance up to low-order factors. The
Smoothed Striding Algorithm introduces randomization techniques to the
previous (blocked) Striding Algorithm of \cite{Frias08, FrancisPa92},
which was known to perform well in practice but which previously
exhibited poor theoretical guarantees. Our implementation of the
Smoothed Striding Algorithm is fully in-place, exhibits
polylogarithmic span, and has optimal cache performance.

Our work prompts several theoretical questions. Can fast
space-efficient algorithms with polylogarithmic span be found for
other classic problems such as randomly permuting an array
\cite{Anderson90, AlonsoSc96, ShunGu15}, and integer sorting
\cite{Rajasekaran92, HanHe12, AlbersHa97, Han01, GerbessiotisSi04}?
Such algorithms are of both theoretical and practical interest, and
might be able to utilize some of the techniques introduced in this
paper.

Another important direction of work is the design of in-place parallel
algorithms for sample-sort, the variant of quicksort in which multiple
pivots are used simultaneously in each partition. Sample-sort can be
implemented to exhibit fewer cache misses than quicksort, which is be
especially important when the computation is memory-bandwidth
bound. The known in-place parallel algorithms for sample-sort rely
heavily on atomic instructions \cite{AxtmannWi17} (even requiring
128-bit compare-and-swap instructions). Finding fast algorithms that
use only exclusive-read-write memory (or
concurrent-read-exclusive-write memory) is an important direction of
future work.


\section{Acknowledgements}

This project was performed as part of the MIT PRIMES program at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The MIT PRIMES program
selects talented high-school students in math and computer science
(through a problem-based application that tests students' mathematics,
programming, and problem-solving abilities) and gives them
opportunities to work with MIT graduate students in Math and Computer
Science on unsolved research projects. This project was performed by
student Alek Westover with mentorship from MIT Computer Science PhD
student William Kuszmaul.

William Kuszmaul's prior work on developing an in-place parallel-partition algorithm was motivation for the student's project.
Kuszmaul's in-place algorithm is primarily of theoretical interest, and its performance bottlenecks led to the direction of research of cache-efficient algorithms.
The main contribution of the project is a cache-efficient in-place EREW parallel-partition algorithm with provable guarantees on span and cache-behavior, and with near-state-of-the-art real-world performance.
  The theoretical ideas and analysis behind this algorithm, as well as the software implementation and experimentation of the algorithm are completely due to the student, Alek Westover. The writeup of the algorithm and its analysis were also performed by the student, with minor editing help by the mentor.

%   presents a non-cache-efficient in-place algorithm for parallel
%   partition, which generalizes the classic parallel-prefix-based
%   algorithm. This contribution is primarily of theoretical
%   interest. Most of this part of the project was performed prior to
