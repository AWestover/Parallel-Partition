# TODO:

## Code
  * see todo list in the code

## English
  *  look at tense agreement. Especially for stuff where I say P_js U_ys etc. It is probably wrong to say "for all indices v_y", instead say "for all indices v_0,v_1,...,v_g-1"

    * read paper for block, collection, group etc consistency  -- bill said to keep reminders of what these are in the paper (ppl prob wont catch on to the fact that we consistently refer to Pj as a part / block etc because its kinda confusing)

  * how much redundancy is good, how much is too much? work on the math / english balance

  * Improve global definitions and usage

## writeup completeness
  * compute work for algorithms (not just span)

  * say more about Bill's algorithm in my paper (look over his paper again, describe his algorithm in my paper?)

  * Add "systems stuff"
    - graphs
    - we need to talk about the fact that we only consider the case where the input size is a multiple of b\cdot s, and how we deal with this (how we deal with it is we just insert the stuff that doesn't fit into the middle)


## writeup correctness
  * make pseudocode show the recursive spawn structure rather than the parallel for loop?
