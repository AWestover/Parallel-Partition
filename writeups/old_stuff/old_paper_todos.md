# Confusions:

- [X]
Q: Is this really EREW?
A: Emphasizez that CREW is really just as good, we assume for loops contant depth, but dispersal of local variables in EREW is "really" log-depth  
@: Bill

- [ ]
Q: inplace - used the term "lowspace" for a not inplace algorithm (space > polylog n)
A: 
  * more emph in prelims
  * reminder in each section on first use
  * clarify that low-space is not in-place
@: Alek (?)

- [X]
Q: How phases in first alg fit together
A: lemma-based format for what invariants are at the end of each phase
@: BIG TODO for Bill

- [X]
Q: pseudocode
A: add it to an appendix
@: alek

- [X]
Q: Cache Confusions
A:
  1) U_i is polylog size and can be partitioned _in cache_
  2) More detailed cache analysis (separate lemma for cache analysis)
  3) Teach Bill what the 2 cache papers [A], [B] are

Q: Why no worst-case inputs for strided (*3)
A: ???????????/ sentence about why that would be useless?
@:  no one

A: increase clarity
@: alek does, bill checks

Q: pg 11 [3.5 and 0.5 #s]
A: clarify

A: separate phase to figure out if preds > succ in first alg

Q: Pinning isn't a real functionality (confused by analysis vs alg barrier)
A: Need sentence: Not actually assuming pinning, Just using the possibility of OPT doing it in the analysis
@: Bill

Q: If you have a lot of threasds could't they use lots of memory?
A: polylog cache *per* processor  [[add in prelims]]
